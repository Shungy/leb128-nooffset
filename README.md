## leb128-nooffset encoding

`leb128-nooffset` is an alternative encoding scheme for Solidity contracts. Currently only the library for LEB128 algorithm exists. But in the future this repo will host the standard for the encoding scheme.

See here for more context: https://gist.github.com/Shungy/125b2c4f8234021fdf2fdf8c34078f21

This idea is still fresh and in extremely early draft phase. Comments and feedback are appreciated.
